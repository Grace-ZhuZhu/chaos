Although this repository was created for learning purposes, it can be easily used as a boilerplate for [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) projects.

One of the biggest advantages of this project setup is that it comes with the [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) package, which  gives you a really simple live reloading. As you will be working mainly with visual output, it is a great thing to have things updated without you having to change to your browser and reload the page manually.

Also, loaders for Babel and Sass are already configured so you are able to take advantages of ES6 features and structure your stylesheets in a fashionable way as well :)

If you want to read more about this project structure and the concepts behind it, you can take a look at [this related post](http://willamesoares.com/d3/setting-up-d3js-with-babel-and-webpack.html).

## Setup

If you already have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm) installed in your machine, you can simply run the commands listed in the steps below.

### 1. Install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```
Or using yarn
```
$ yarn install
```

### 2. Run server
```
$ npm start
```
Or using yarn
```
$ yarn start
```

Now you can open you browser and go to `http://localhost:4800/`. You should see the D3 version this project uses, which is provided by the snippet shown below (also available in `app.js`).

```js
import * as d3 from 'd3'

d3.select('#root')
  .append('h5')
  .append('text')
  .text(`D3 version: ${d3.version}`)
```
## Build

If you wanna generate the minified files for the project you can simply run the command below.

```
$ npm run build
```
Or using yarn
```
$ yarn run build
```

If everything goes alright, then you are ready to start some D3 hacking. Have fun! :)

## Loading external data
As loading external data is one of the most common things in a D3 project, this setup includes a basic flow to serve data files, such as JSON and CSV.  
The `webpack.config.js` file includes a step in which all the files living in the `data` folder are copied to the `dist` folder so you can require them as you want. The default folder is called `data` and lives in the project root. If you want to change the name or location for that folder you just have to update the constant called `paths` in the `webpack.config.js` to match with your desired folder location.

In the `app.js` file you can find an example on loading external files using D3. At the moment you clone this repo, the `sample.csv` file is already copied for you in the `dist` folder. However, if you want to add more data files or change the existing one, you will have to build the project so you will have those modifications available for you in the `dist` folder.

```js
// Loading external data
d3.csv('/data/sample.csv', (error, dataset) => {
  dataset.forEach((data) => {
    console.log(data)
  })
})
```
